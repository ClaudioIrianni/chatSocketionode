Chat with SocketIO on React Native. 

/*Clone repo*/
git clone https://github.com/ClaudioIrianni/chatSocketionode.git

This chat works with Expo and Node v16.13.0, you can use NVM (Node version manager) or downgrade your node version.

!Im trying to fix the chat to work on mobile. Right now it only works for WEB
